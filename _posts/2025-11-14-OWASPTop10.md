## Top 10 background

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 is a globally recognised standard for identifying the most critical security risks in web applications. It is produced by an open-source community, dedicated to providing guidance for  organisations to develop, purchase and maintain trusted web based projects.

The top 10 list ranks attack vectors based on severity, with number 1 being the most severe. The list is updated every three to four years to account for the advances in technology, with the last update coming in 2021.The process involves surveying developers and security professionals, analysing the data, drafting the candidate document, public release, then finally adoption and implementation.

Since the last update in 2021, there has been building anticipation for the release of the new 2025 standard. Although the changes are still in the release candidate phase, it is unlikely to change (or if it does the changes will be minor) before it is confirmed as the recognised standard.

## Category Structure for 2025

The 2025 edition removes previous restrictions on Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) and tracks how widespread each weakness is across applications. Instead of counting how often a vulnerability appears, OWASP focuses on how many applications contain it. The dataset has grown significantly, from about 30 CWEs in 2017 to 589 in this edition, requiring new ways to group and organise categories.

Categories now emphasise **root causes** (like “Cryptographic Failures”) over **symptoms** (like “Sensitive Data Exposure”) to better guide prevention and remediation. Each category includes multiple related CWEs, averaging around 25, to ensure comprehensive coverage. This approach helps organisations tailor training and security efforts to their languages and frameworks.

## Data Collection

The list is based on data but not entirely driven by it. The team looks at vulnerability data to identify trends but also uses community surveys to capture emerging risks that might not yet appear in testing data. This balance ensures the list reflects both historical patterns and real-world experiences from security professionals.

OWASP keeps broader categories instead of listing individual CWEs, unlike MITRE’s Top 25. This is because not all CWEs apply to every programming language, and many vulnerabilities have multiple CWEs describing similar issues. Grouping them under shared categories (like Injection or Misconfiguration) gives a clearer, more universal picture of security risks.

Automated testing data doesn’t capture all vulnerabilities, especially newer or harder-to-detect ones. To account for this gap, OWASP selects **eight categories** based on data and **two from community feedback**. These survey-driven categories reflect risks practitioners see in the field that might not yet appear in automated tools or datasets.

## What’s New
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/OWASP.png)
Drawing a comparison to the 2021 standard, it’s evident that there has been some movement towards the top of the list, with a consolidation and addition at the bottom. Broken Access Control remains the top security risk as just under 4% of applications tested had one or more of the 40 Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) in this category. Server-side request forgery has also been rolled into the access control category as can be seen by the yellow dotted line.

The categories of Cryptographic failures, Injection and insecure design have moved down the list this year, while Security Misconfigurations and Vulnerable and outdated Components have risen to second and third place, with the latter changing description to Software Supply Chain Failures. Identification and Authentication Failures, Software and Data Integrity Failures, and Security Logging and Monitoring Failures have remained in the same positions as Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions makes its way on to the list in the tenth spot.

## Conclusion

The full details of each category are available on the OWASP official website here - [Introduction - OWASP Top 10:2025 RC1](https://owasp.org/Top10/2025/0x00_2025-Introduction/). The top 10 list moves with cybersecurity trends. What is judged to be severe today, may be irrelevant in future as technology advances. With the leaps and bounds that AI has made in the past few years, it is impossible to predict what the top 10 list will look like in 2029.
