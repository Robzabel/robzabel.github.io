An effective threat inteligence pipeline requires a structured approach. The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle is a standard methodology that provides a comprehensive process designed to convert raw data into actionable threat intelligence. Originally designed by the CIA, the lifecycle advocates six stages of intel gathering and dissemination:

* **Planning and direction** - Clearly define goals and objectives before starting to gather data. Without a clear end goal, it is easy to get side tracked which can lead to an abundance of data that is not relevant.

* **Data collection** - Acquiring data from OSINT, Social media, dark web, honeypots and threat feeds as well as internal logs, network traffic and external partners.

* **Processing and exploitation** - Ensuring data relevance and accuracy through filtering, normalising and enriching, along with using automated tools to remove duplicates and correlate with known threats.

* **Analysis and production** -  Evaluating the impact and likelihood of threats on assets, operations, and reputation, considering factors like threat actor motivation , capabilities and impact to create a forecast of attacks and outcomes.

* **Dissemination of gathered information** - Delivering clear concise and actionable findings to stakeholders through reports, briefings, or alerts that detail threat nature, potential impact and mitigation strategies.

* **Feedback on usefulness** - Evalution on wheter the intelligence was helpful and accurate is essential. Feedback is then used to influence the planning and direction phase of the next intelligence creation cycle.
